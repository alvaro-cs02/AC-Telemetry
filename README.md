# Assetto Corsa Telemetry Toolkit

Welcome to the Assetto Corsa Telemetry Toolkit! This project is a versatile Python toolkit designed for Assetto Corsa enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone in between. It allows for highly customizable telemetry data extraction and analysis, suited for a variety of purposes beyond just racing. Whether you're analyzing lap times, investigating vehicle dynamics in simulated real-world scenarios, or conducting educational projects, this toolkit has got you covered.

## Features

- **Customizable Data Extraction**: Choose exactly what telemetry data you want to capture, from speed and acceleration to more intricate details like tire pressure and suspension travel. All of this can be customized through a simple configuration file.

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Turn your raw telemetry data into insightful visual representations with our built-in visualization tool. Explore your data through interactive graphs and charts, making it easier to analyze and understand.

- **Versatile Application**: Whether you're a racer looking to improve your lap times, a researcher conducting studies, or an educator using Assetto Corsa for teaching physics concepts, this toolkit is designed to adapt to your needs.
